#Usage

The eclipse task editor can be used to create and manage textual todo files. The syntax is based on [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper), an excellent to-do list manager  for Mac OS X./
A todo file consists of four elements: Tasks, Notes, Projects, and Tags. 

* *Tasks:* Something that needs to be done. A task is preceeded by '-'.
* *Notes:* Arbitrary text.
* *Projects:* Projects can be used to structure tasks. Projects are followed by ':' and a linebreak.
* *Tags:* can be used to categorize tasks. Tags start with '@'.
